Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Network (MNIST Dataset)
MNIST Dataset

This is a repository for a project that demonstrates handwritten digit classification using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification, widely used in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

Description
In this project, we aim to build and train a neural network model to accurately classify handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset. We'll use the TensorFlow library to create and train the neural network, and then evaluate its performance on the test set.

The main steps of the project include:

Data Loading: We'll download the MNIST dataset and preprocess the images to prepare them for training.

Model Architecture: Design and define the neural network architecture to be used for digit classification.

Training: Train the neural network on the training data and adjust the model's parameters to optimize its performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's accuracy on the test dataset to measure its performance.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is already included in the repository under the "data" folder. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (28x28 grayscale images).

Results
After training the neural network on the MNIST dataset, we'll display and analyze the accuracy achieved by the model on the test set. Additionally, we may provide some visualizations of misclassified images and confusion matrices to gain insights into the model's performance.
